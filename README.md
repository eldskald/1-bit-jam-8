# Sands of Time

You're an archaeologist exploring the ruins of an empire that's been gone for centuries. Learn about its people, reconnect with the past e re-learn what's been forgotten.

This game is a submission to [1-BIT Jam](https://itch.io/jam/1-bit-jam-8). You can play this game on a web browser or download Windows and Linux versions on its [itch.io page](https://eldskald.itch.io/sands-of-time).
